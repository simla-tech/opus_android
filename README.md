# Opus for Android

Welcome to the Opus library for Android.

## Summary

This is an Android library transplanted from official Opus codec. With this library, Opus format audio can be operated in an easy way. Application level function includes audio record, playback, encode and decode.

## Integration
Add the following dependency to your project.
```
implementation 'com.simla.android.opuslib:opuslib:1.0.3'
```

### How to use the OpusLib codes (Method 1)

OpusService is the highest level interface to programmer. It's a background Server running automatically. All you need to do is sending Intents to it, and receiving the feedback messages through a Broadcast Receiver. The approach is recommended over the Method 2.

#### Sending message.

Many static public method can be called directly. For details, please refer to the source code of OpusService.java
```
OpusService.play(Context context, String fileName);
OpusService.record(Context context, String fileName);
......
```
#### Receiving message.

A Broadcast Receiver is needed to receive the feadback messages while playing, recording or converting a opus file. Below is an example.
```
//register a broadcast receiver
mReceiver = new OpusReceiver();
IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter();
filter.addAction(OpusEvent.ACTION_OPUS_UI_RECEIVER);
registerReceiver(mReceiver, filter);

//define a broadcast receiver
class OpusReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
        public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
            Bundle bundle = intent.getExtras();
            int type = bundle.getInt(OpusEvent.EVENT_TYPE, 0);
            switch (type) {
                case OpusEvent.CONVERT_FINISHED:
                    break;
                case OpusEvent.CONVERT_FAILED:
                    break;
                case OpusEvent.CONVERT_STARTED:
                    break;
                case OpusEvent.RECORD_FAILED:
                    break;
                case OpusEvent.RECORD_FINISHED:
                    break;
                case OpusEvent.RECORD_STARTED:
                    break;
                case OpusEvent.RECORD_PROGRESS_UPDATE:
                    break;
                case OpusEvent.PLAY_PROGRESS_UPDATE:
                    break;
                case OpusEvent.PLAY_GET_AUDIO_TRACK_INFO:
                    break;
                case OpusEvent.PLAYING_FAILED:
                    break;
                case OpusEvent.PLAYING_FINISHED:
                    break;
                case OpusEvent.PLAYING_PAUSED:
                    break;
                case OpusEvent.PLAYING_STARTED:
                    break;
                default:
                    Log.d(TAG, intent.toString() + "Invalid request,discarded");
                    break;
            }
        }
    }

```


### How to use the OpusLib codes (Method 2)
- Encode and Decode
```
OpusTool oTool = new OpusTool();
oTool.decode(fileName,fileNameOut, null);
oTool.encode(fileName, fileNameOut, null);
```
- Playback
```
OpusPlayer opusPlayer = OpusPlayer.getInstance();
opusPlayer.play(fileName);
opusPlayer.stop();
```
- Record
```
OpusRecorder opusRecorder = OpusRecorder.getInstance();
opusRecorder.startRecording(fileName);
opusRecorder.stopRecording();
```
**Well, you can stop reading if you don't need to modify the library code.** Your project should be working if you follow the steps above.

##Project Compilation

- pre-requisites

1.	JDK v1.8 or higher  
2.	SDK v2.2.1 or higher  
3.	NDK  r10d or higher (Note: remember to export NDK's path) 
4.	Android Studio (with SDK) 1.2.1 or higher  

- Summary of set up:

1.	Get the source code.[Git] (https://github.com/louisyonge/opus_android.git)  
2	remember to export NDK's path. Take Linux for example, add the following code to the end of the file "/etc/profile", and then reboot your system.
```
NDK_ROOT=/usr/local/lib/android-ndk-r9d
export PATH=$NDK_ROOT:$PATH
```

3.	Open it in Android Studio, and modify the path of SDK and NDK in the file "local.properties"
4.	Compile and run.  

- Testing Hints:

1. This demo use external storage to store audio file. Be sure your Android device has a SD card when testing this demo. You could also store them in internal storage by changing source code.
2. Recommend to use a real Android device instead of Android virtual device. . Some times AVD has no sound system supports.
3. When testing the master branch, firstly you need to copy at least one wav file and an opus file to the folder "OpusPlayer" under the root of SD card. Secondly, launch the demo. Then you can play or encode/decode these audio files.

## NDK Compilation
### Development Environment

SDK, NDK, Android Studio, Eclipse

Note: Android Studio 1.2 does not support the debug of Native code. So it is wise to develop the C&C++ code in Eclipse. For this project, codes under the folder "OpusPlayer\opuslib\src\main\jni" are Native codes. The rest of this project is Java codes, developed by Android Studio.(deprecated)

### How to debug Native code

* Android NDK compiler
1. cd "OpusPlayer\opuslib\src\main\jni".
2. Issure command "ndk-build".
5. Click build in Android Studio.
6. Watch logs in logcat.
* Linux
As Android Studio does not support JNI debugging(for version 1.2 and earlier), using Eclipse in Linux is a good way to debug Native codes. There is a valid Makefile under the JNI folder of this project. So you can ether import the JNI code to a Eclipse project, or just cd to the folder and issue compile command "make". When compiling for Linux, Comment out "#define ANDROID_V" in the file "\OpusPlayer\opuslib\src\main\jni\include\config.h", and uncomment it when compiling by for Android. This Macro is a switch to redirect std-stream to logcat, and vice versa. "Opus_demo.c" is the console demo of testing opuslib for Linux. Cygwin is not recommended, because you might encounter some strange compilation problem.
